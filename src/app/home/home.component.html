    ngx-datatable is an Angular component for presenting large and complex data. It has all the
    features you would expect from any other table but in a light package with no external dependencies.
    The table was designed to be extremely flexible and light; it doesn't make any assumptions about
    your data or how you: filter, sort or page it. It also support "row detail" and "row grouping".
  </p>

  <p class="home-box2">
    In this demo you can find 3 examples: "filter, sort and  page", "row grouping", "row detail".<br>
    <a mat-button color="primary" [routerLink]="'/page1'">"filter, sort and  page"</a>
    <a mat-button color="primary" [routerLink]="'/page2'">"row detail"</a>
    <a mat-button color="primary" [routerLink]="'/page3'">"row grouping"</a>
